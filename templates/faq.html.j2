<h2 id="what-is">What's Eardogger?</h2>

<p>Eardogger is a bookmarking service for long webcomics and web-books.</p>

<p>There's lots of ways to bookmark a web page, but this one is weird because it's designed for <em>reading</em> (instead of <em>remembering</em> or <em>researching</em>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Only one bookmark per site.</strong> A marked page is just a temporary resting point in a larger work; when you read further and save your place again, Eardogger moves your old bookmark. In other words, it does "yesterday's bus ticket" bookmarks, not "six colors of sticky note" bookmarks.</li>
  <li><strong>Available everywhere.</strong> Pause your reading on one device, resume wherever.</li>
  <li><strong>Incredibly lazy.</strong> Pause or resume with one click on sites you've bookmarked before.</li>
  <li><strong>Calls bookmarks "dogears"??</strong> I liked how sloppy and disreputable it sounded. üê∂</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to">How to Use Eardogger</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up for a free account.</li>
  <li><a href="/install">Install the "Mark my spot" and "Where was I" bookmarklets</a> on all your devices and browsers.</li>
  <li>To pause whatever you're reading, click "Mark my spot."
    <ul>
      <li>If you've dogeared that site before, that's it! The dogear now marks your new position.</li>
      <li>If this is a new site, Eardogger asks you for the site's name and makes a new dogear. (You can also adjust the URL prefix, for sites that share a domain with several other sites.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To resume reading a site from where you paused it, use the list of dogears on the <a href="/">Eardogger homepage</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Or, if you're already on that site, click "Where was I." (Good for when you left a tab open but then read further on another device.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>November 27, 2022</h3>

<p>I guess it's about time for the yearly-ish maintenance to this site! There've been some changes around here. Here's a brief rundown of everything that's going to be different going forward for my two or three semi-active users:</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>...Yep: it was another round of internal or infrastructural updates with no perceptible effect on the function of the site.</p>

<p>What happened is that I'd been running Eardogger on Heroku's free tier (like the scrub that I am), and they decided this year that they were going to shut that free tier down and push all the hobby apps onto their paid plans. Which is absolutely 100% a fair enough decision that I don't begrudge them in the slightest! I've gotten a lot of value out of that free tier, and they didn't have to give me any of it. And they're probably pretty sick of hosting cryptominers or whatever.</p>

<p><strong>However.</strong> Although I'm happy to pay for what I use, Heroku's paid tiers ‚Äî¬†even the new cheaper ones they just added ‚Äî¬†are more expensive than an app like Eardogger can justify. I love all three of you, but I don't "ten-plus dollars every month for a single barely-used app" love you. So I had to hustle to get us onto some other platform(s).</p>

<p>I ended up going with <a href="https://fly.io">Fly</a> for the app container, and an upstart serverless Postgres thingy called <a href="https://neon.tech">Neon</a> for the database. Fly's free tier is quite generous (so I'm still living scrub life), but if I end up hosting bunch of other little containerized apps there, the bill for the surplus is more like $2 per. Neon doesn't even have paid tiers yet because it's baby, but it <em>looks</em> like their tech stack is actually novel enough to let them bill much more granularly than any of the existing Postgres-as-a-service outfits do, if they so choose. It'll be interesting to see how that shakes out!</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>Have any questions been frequently asked yet?</h3>

<p>Noootttttt really. I guess just text or @ me if you've got something.</p>

<h3>Can I save my place halfway through a page, or do I have to start at the top of a page?</h3>

<p>If there are clickable "anchors" within a long page, you can save your spot at one of those; you just need to click it before you save, so that the anchor is included in the URL that gets sent to Eardogger.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch00-00-introduction.html">The Rust book</a> does this, if you want to see an example; all the headers are clickable anchors.</p>

<h3>Is this ~social~?</h3>

<p>This is absolutely not ~social~. üåª I endorse texting your besties about what you're reading and/or avidly blogging that shit, but this website's highest ambition is to be a  üíæ ÔΩóÔΩÖÔΩÇ„ÄÄÔΩìÔΩÉÔΩÅÔΩåÔΩÖüíΩ version of the disintegrating receipt that's been marking your spot in <em>Ancillary Justice.</em></p>

<h3>What is "elegance through stupidity?"</h3>

<p>A nebulous design quality that I admire and aspire to.</p>
