//! OK, so here's the scoop: we have some javascript files. We want to turn
//! them into bookmarklets (i.e. minify then mangle with url-encoding). But
//! we want to *maintain* them in unmangled form.
//!
//! Also, one of the bookmarklets requires a token to be inserted at runtime,
//! and they both need a URL inserted at runtime. So they're templates, too,
//! and they have different escaping rules than HTML templates.
//!
//! Ideally, we don't want to pay the cost of mangling these things at request
//! time, or even at startup time (since startup time is pretty frequent under
//! my desired deployment conditions). And it occurred to me that I could use
//! a build script to pre-minify and url-encode the templates, then make sure
//! to insert double-escaped (JS string context + url context) text at runtime.
//! However, turns out this is a slightly harder problem than just performing
//! existing eardogger 1 logic at a different point in time, because of the
//! `{{ template expressions }}` -- they're gonna get whomped by the url-encoding
//! if I try to pre-load that, so I'd need to write some logic to "url-encode
//! EXCEPT for template expressions and/or tags", and, buddy, whoof.
//!
//! So anyway, long story short we're doing this with a lil bit of wasteful
//! computation instead of my beatiful excessively optimized concept. But,
//! maybe someday.
